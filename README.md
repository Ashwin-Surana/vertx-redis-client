# Vert.x Redis Service

The Vert.x Redis service provides asynchronous connectivity to a [Redis](http://redis.io) data-structure server.

Keep in mind that while the Vert.x service provides support for the complete [Redis command set](http://redis.io/commands),
 a working knowledge of the Redis runtime is strongly encouraged. Where there appears to be a discrepancy between this
  documentation and the [Redis documentation set](http://redis.io/documentation), the Redis literature takes precedence.

This project is based on original work from Paulo Lopes. The original repository for the module can be found
 at [https://github.com/vert-x/mod-redis](https://github.com/vert-x/mod-redis).

## Redis Service

While it is assumed you are familar with Redis, using the Redis service is straightforward

### Creating and Starting

<pre>
	RedisService service = RedisService.create(vertx, config());

    service.start(asyncResult -> {
      if (asyncResult.succeeded()) {
        String address = config().getString("address", "vertx.redis");
        ProxyHelper.registerService(RedisService.class, vertx, service, address);
        startFuture.complete();

      } else {
        startFuture.fail(asyncResult.cause());
      }
    });	
</pre>


### Usage
<pre>
    service.set(toJsonArray(mykey, "Hello"), reply -> {
	  if(reply.succeeded()) {
        redis.get(toJsonArray(mykey), reply1 -> {
        assertTrue(reply1.succeeded());
        assertEquals("Hello", reply1.result());
        testComplete();
      });	  
	 }
    });
</pre>

If you are familar with Vert.x and Redis, the above code snippets will not be unfamiliar to you. As previously mentioned,
 the Redis Service supports the entire Redis Command Set allowing you full control of the Redis runtime as with any other API.
